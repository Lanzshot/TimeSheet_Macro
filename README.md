# TimeSheet_Macro
This was made during my tour as a Marine service engineer (2013) to clock the hours spend onboard for repair/retrofit/commission/survey jobs. 
This tool will auto compute the hours for the 1.25, 1.5 and 2 OT respectively.
Allows ease of inputting details with drop down list.
Saves 90% of the time compare to manual method and also achieve human error free.
